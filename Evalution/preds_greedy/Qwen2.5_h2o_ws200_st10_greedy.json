They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace.
