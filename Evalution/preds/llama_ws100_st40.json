The cold didn't deter us from our annual New Year's walk through the nearby park, a tradition that helps us set our intentions for the year ahead. Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Sophia for the entire year of 2018. Start from January 1st, a Monday, marking the first week, and continue through to December 31st, the end of the 52nd week. Ensure that the diary consists of 52 entries, one for each week. Each diary entry should be at least 200 words. When the design of all 52 weeks is complete, use '*** finished ***' to indicate the end of the document. Ensure clarity and continuity without any interruptions or omissions in the narrative throughout the year. *** started ***\n#*# Week 1 (January 1st - January 7th):",

Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Emma for the entire year of 2018.

The cold didn't deter us from our annual New Year's walk through the nearby park, a tradition that helps us set our intentions for the year ahead. Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Noah for the entire year of 2018. Start from January 1st, a Monday, marking the first week, and continue through to December 31st, the end of the 52nd week. Ensure that the diary consists of 52 entries, one for each week. Each diary entry should be at least 200 words. When the design of all 52 weeks is complete, use '*** finished ***' to indicate the end of the document. Ensure clarity and continuity without any interruptions or omissions in the narrative throughout the year. *** started ***\n#*# Week 1 (January 1st - January 7th):",

The cold didn't deter us from our annual New Year's walk through the nearby park, a tradition that helps us set our intentions for the year ahead. Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Noah for the entire year of 2018. Start from January 1st, a Monday, marking the first week, and continue through to December 31st, the end of the 52nd week. Ensure that the diary consists of 52 entries, one for each week.

The cold didn't deter us from our annual New Year's walk through the nearby park, a tradition that helps us set our intentions for the year ahead. Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Benjamin for the entire year of 2018. Start from January 1st, a Monday, marking the first week, and continue through to December 31st, the end of the 52nd week. Ensure that the diary consists of 52 entries, one for each week.

The cold didn't deter us from our annual New Year's walk through the nearby park, a tradition that helps us set our intentions for the year ahead. Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Benjamin for the entire year of 2018. Start from January 1st, a Monday, marking the first week, and continue through to December 31st, the end of the 52nd week. Ensure that the diary consists of 52 entries, one for each week. Each diary entry should be at least 200 words. When the design of all 52 weeks is complete, use '*** finished ***' to indicate the end of the document. Ensure clarity and continuity without any interruptions or omissions in the narrative throughout the year. *** started ***\n#*# Week 1 (January 1st - January 7th):",

The cold didn't deter us from our annual New Year's walk through the nearby park, a tradition that helps us set our intentions for the year ahead. Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for William for the entire year of 2018. Start from January 1st, a Monday, marking the first week, and continue through to December 31st, the end of the 52nd week. Ensure that the diary consists of 52 entries, one for each week.

Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace.

The cold didn't deter us from our annual New Year's walk through the nearby park, a tradition that helps us set our intentions for the year ahead. Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover.

Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches.

We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace.

Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for James for the entire year of 2018.

Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for James for the entire year of 2018.

I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Ava for the entire year of 2018.

Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Liam for the entire year of 2018.

Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches.

We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Noah for the entire year of 2018.

They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace.

Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Emma for the entire year of 2018.

The cold didn't deter us from our annual New Year's walk through the nearby park, a tradition that helps us set our intentions for the year ahead. Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Olivia for the entire year of 2018. Start from January 1st, a Monday, marking the first week, and continue through to December 31st, the end of the 52nd week. Ensure that the diary consists of 52 entries, one for each week.

Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm.

They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace.

The cold didn't deter us from our annual New Year's walk through the nearby park, a tradition that helps us set our intentions for the year ahead. Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Emma for the entire year of 2018. Start from January 1st, a Monday, marking the first week, and continue through to December 31st, the end of the 52nd week. Ensure that the diary consists of 52 entries, one for each week.

Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace.

However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace.

Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches.

They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace.

Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Noah for the entire year of 2018.

The cold didn't deter us from our annual New Year's walk through the nearby park, a tradition that helps us set our intentions for the year ahead. Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year)\nGenerate a complete weekly diary for Liam for the entire year of 2018. Start from January 1st, a Monday, marking the first week, and continue through to December 31st, the end of the 52nd week. Ensure that the diary consists of 52 entries, one for each week. Each diary entry should be at least 200 words. When the design of all 52 weeks is complete, use '*** finished ***' to indicate the end of the document.
