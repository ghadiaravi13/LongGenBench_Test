As for me, I worked on refining my design skills, focusing on the importance of materials and textures in architecture.\n\n#*# Week 52 (December 24th - December 31st): \nThis week, our family celebrated Christmas in style. We spent the day decorating the house, cooking a delicious meal, and exchanging thoughtful gifts. The kids are having a blast, enjoying the festive atmosphere and quality time with their family.

We spent the evening relaxing by the fire, sharing stories and memories from our years together, and looking forward to the new year ahead.\n*** finished ***. \n*** started ***\n#*# Week 53 (January 1st - January 7th): \nThe New Year dawned frosty and bright, with temperatures stubbornly clinging to a cool 5°C. The cold didn't deter us from our annual New Year's walk through the nearby park, a tradition that helps us set our intentions for the year ahead. Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2019, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover. As for the weekend, it brought a gentle snowfall that transformed our neighborhood into a serene winter landscape, perfect for some impromptu snowball fights and hot chocolate by the fireplace. Overall, the week was a blend of reflection, planning, and familial warmth, setting a hopeful tone for the new year.\n\n#*# Week 54 (January 8th - January 14th): \nThe winter chill still holds, but the days are growing longer. Today, my wife surprised me with a beautiful orchid to celebrate the beginning of our 6th wedding anniversary month. As we unwrapped the present, our youngest child squealed with delight and demanded to hold the lovely flower. My wife and I exchanged a tender moment, remembering our wedding day and the journey we've shared so far. Our household hummed with the usual morning routine, punctuated by a family outing to the science museum. Our older children excitedly showed me the fossil exhibit, rekindling my enthusiasm for the subject. After a quick lunch, we headed home, where the kids immediately launched into their evening activities: the toddler played with building blocks while the older ones began working on their math homework. This weekend brought more snow and colder temperatures, but the quiet provided ample time for reading and self-improvement. I spent hours researching new materials for a project, feeling invigorated by the prospect of tackling this new challenge.\n\n#*# Week 55 (January 15th - January 21st): \nIt's our middle child's birthday today, and the family is full of excitement. We have planned a lovely celebration with her closest friends and a homemade cake that looks like a pink princess castle. Our little princess is turning 9, and her energy levels are soaring higher than ever. We decorated the living room with balloons, streamers, and banners bearing her name and favorite cartoon character. As the children ran around, laughing and playing games, I helped their mom set up the party area with a photo booth filled with fun props. The birthday cake, an edible masterpiece, was the centerpiece of our dinner table. The children sang happy birthday to our little one, who beamed with joy and devoured her cake in three bites. After the party, we spent some quality time watching movies together and sharing stories of past birthday memories. This week also marked a productive week at the office, where I was able to finalize the design for a new community center project.\n\n#*# Week 56 (January 22nd - January 28th): \nWinter's grip on the city loosens ever so slightly, allowing us a hint of spring's presence. This week saw the family tackle some much-needed cleaning and organization at home. The kids' toys and clothes filled every available space, making our once tidy living room a daunting challenge. After a few days of sorting, we finally reclaimed some of our space, leaving the living room looking fresh and calm. We also took a short trip to the local botanical garden, where the beauty of nature recharged our batteries and reminded us of the world's vast wonders. As for my professional life, this week was filled with collaborations and brainstorming sessions, resulting in a new design concept that has our team excited. I spent the evening catching up on some reading and researching new technologies that will shape our industry's future.\n\n#*# Week 57 (January 29th - February 4th): \nThis week kicked off with a family visit from my wife's parents. They arrived bearing gifts and stories of their recent travels. We spent the first few days getting to know them better, enjoying family time, and sharing stories of our lives. My mother-in-law, an avid cook, offered to teach my wife some new recipes, which turned out to be a fun and tasty experience for everyone. As the visit came to an end, we realized that the time flew by all too quickly, and we were reluctant to bid each other farewell. At work, I led a design review with our team, showcasing the progress on the community center project and gathering valuable feedback from my colleagues. The meeting resulted in a more streamlined approach, allowing us to stay on track and deliver quality results.\n\n#*# Week 58 (February 5th - February 11th): \nLove is in the air! My wife surprised me with tickets to a local concert, celebrating our 6th wedding anniversary a bit earlier than planned. We danced the night away, enjoying the music and each other's company. The show was an incredible experience, and we left with a renewed sense of love and appreciation for one another. This week also saw a family outing to the nearby ice rink, where we spent the afternoon laughing and trying to stay on our feet. My toddler took an instant liking to the colorful ice skates and insisted on wearing them all the way home, much to everyone's amusement. At work, our team welcomed a new member, a talented designer who will undoubtedly help us grow and excel in our field.\n\n#*# Week 59 (February 12th - February 18th): \nThis week was a bit of a rollercoaster. Our younger child fell ill with a nasty cold, leaving us scrambling to manage the household and ensure everyone's well-being. Despite the chaos, my wife and I made a concerted effort to take care of our little one and keep the household running smoothly. Thankfully, our older children pitched in, helping with small tasks and comforting their younger sibling. At work, we completed the first phase of the community center project, and the results exceeded our expectations. We celebrated the milestone with a team lunch, relishing the sense of accomplishment that comes with overcoming challenges.\n\n#*"}
