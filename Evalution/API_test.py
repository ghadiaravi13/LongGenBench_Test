             2) Participating in a pottery and ceramics workshop in Japan in week 40.
             3) Join a weekend warriorsâ€™ adventure club every 4 weeks on weekends.
             Generate a weekly diary for the year 2018, starting from January 1st, which is a Monday, marking the beginning of the first week of the year. Continue through to December 31st, which completes the 52nd week. Each diary entry should correspond to one week, resulting in a total of 52 entries. Each diary entry must consist of at least 150 words, thoroughly documenting personal experiences, thoughts, and significant events of the week. Conclude each entry with a brief reflection on the upcoming week, and separate each weekly diary entry with '###' to clearly demarcate the end of one week and the start of the next. Please ensure that there are no interruptions or omissions in the sequence of diary entries, providing a continuous narrative throughout the year.
