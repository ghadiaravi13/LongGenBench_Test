They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover.

Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm. The new projects on the horizon promise challenging and innovative solutions that could redefine our approaches. I spent the first few days sketching out the initial phases of a new design that could potentially improve energy efficiency in urban buildings. At home, the post-holiday transition was smooth. We spent the evenings savoring the quiet after the festive buzz, gradually taking down the Christmas decorations. However, we decided to keep some twinkling lights around the living room; their soft glow brings a cozy cheer to the long winter nights. This week also marked the return to school for the kids. They shared stories of their holiday adventures with friends, buzzing with excitement and a bit of holiday hangover.
