At the lab, we were deep into the planning stages of our new projects, with brainstorming sessions and design meetings taking place daily. I was particularly excited about a new collaboration with a local architectural firm, which could lead to some groundbreaking advancements in sustainable urban design. Meanwhile, at home, my wife and I were busy organizing the kids' schedules for the upcoming school year. We signed them up for various extracurricular activities, including soccer, art classes, and music lessons. The evenings were spent helping them with their homework and preparing healthy meals.
