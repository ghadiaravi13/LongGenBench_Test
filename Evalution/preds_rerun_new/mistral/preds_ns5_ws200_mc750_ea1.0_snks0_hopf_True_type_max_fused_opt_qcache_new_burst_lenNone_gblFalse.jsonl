Start from January 1st, a Monday, marking the first week, and continue through to December 31st, the end of the 52nd week. Ensure that the diary consists of 52 entries, one for each week. Each diary entry should be at least 200 words. When the design of all 52 weeks is complete, use '*** finished ***' to indicate the end of the document. Ensure clarity and continuity without any interruptions or omissions in the narrative throughout the year. *** started ***\n#*# Week 1 (January 1st - January 7th):", "checks_once": {"19": "husband (yourself) birthday", "38": "my wife birthday", "36": "my child_1 birthday", "30": "my father birthday", "23": "my mother birthday"}, "checks_range": {"24": "Attending a fashion week in Paris", "25": "Attending a fashion week in Paris"}, "checks_periodic": {"13": "Attend a parenting workshop", "18": "Attend a parenting workshop", "23": "Attend a parenting workshop", "28": "Attend a parenting workshop", "33": "Attend a parenting workshop", "38": "Attend a parenting workshop", "43": "Attend a parenting workshop", "48": "Attend a parenting workshop"}, "type": "Week", "prefix": "#*# Week 1 (January 1st - January 7th):", "number": 52, "response": "\nThe New Year dawned frosty and bright, with temperatures stubbornly clinging to a cool 5°C.
