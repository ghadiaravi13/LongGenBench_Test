The cold didn't deter us from our annual New Year's walk through the nearby park, a tradition that helps us set our intentions for the year ahead. Wrapped in our warmest coats, my wife and I discussed our personal and professional goals for 2018, making plans to nurture both our careers and our family. Back at work this week, the atmosphere in the engineering lab was charged with fresh energy and enthusiasm.
